### Option B: Give to AI Agent

**Copy this message and send to your AI agent:**

Hi! I have a Python script ready for you to import products into my Revoa platform.

**What you need to do:**

1. The script file is `ai_agent_import.py` (I'll share the contents below)
2. Run it in your Python environment
3. Report back the results

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library (install with `pip install requests`)

**The script is fully configured with:**
- Admin credentials: tyler@revoa.app / RevoaAI17
- 3 pilot products pre-loaded
- Automatic login and import

Just run: `python ai_agent_import.py`

**Script contents:**
```python
[Copy the contents of ai_agent_import.py here]
```

After you run it, report back:
- ‚úÖ How many products imported successfully
- ‚ùå Any errors that occurred
- üìã The product IDs created

Once imported, I'll review and approve them in the admin panel!

## After Import

1. **Check Admin Panel**
   - Go to https://members.revoa.app/admin/products
   - You should see 3 products with "pending" status

2. **Review Products**
   - Solar Step Lights ($9.80 ‚Üí $29.40)
   - Draft Stopper ($6.50 ‚Üí $19.50)
   - Resistance Bands ($11.00 ‚Üí $33.00)

3. **Approve Them**
   - Click on each product
   - Review the details
   - Click "Approve" (green checkmark)

4. **Verify in Catalog**
   - Go to https://members.revoa.app/products
   - Products should now be visible to all users

## What the AI Agent Does Next

After this pilot succeeds, the AI agent can:

1. **Upload Real Assets**
   - Download images from Instagram reels
   - Upload to Supabase Storage: `product-assets` bucket
   - Update products with real image URLs

2. **Verify Pricing**
   - Check Amazon and AliExpress for actual costs
   - Update supplier_price and recommended_retail_price
   - Add source URLs to metadata

3. **Create Marketing Content**
   - Generate text-free demo GIFs (1-5 seconds each)
   - Write ad copy variations
   - Create headline options

4. **Scale Up**
   - Import batches of 5-10 products
   - Use the same script, just modify the products array
   - Keep using external_id to prevent duplicates

## Troubleshooting

### Login Fails (400/401 error)

**Problem:** tyler@revoa.app doesn't exist or password is wrong

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Check if user exists
3. If not, create it (see "Before You Start" section above)
4. Make sure password is exactly: `RevoaAI17` (capital R, capital A, capital I)

### Login Succeeds But Import Fails (403 error)

**Problem:** User exists but doesn't have admin permissions

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí user_profiles
2. Find tyler@revoa.app's row
3. Set `is_admin` to `true`
4. Set `admin_role` to `super_admin`

### Products Don't Appear

**Problem:** Products are in "pending" status

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://members.revoa.app/admin/products
2. Click the "Pending" filter button (should be selected by default)
3. Products should be there
4. If not, check the import script output for errors

### Network/Connection Errors

**Problem:** Can't reach Supabase endpoint

**Solution:**
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try running from a different network
- Check if Supabase is down: https://status.supabase.com/

## Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Verify tyler@revoa.app exists and has admin permissions
3. Make sure the password is exactly `RevoaAI17`
4. Try running the script again (it's safe to re-run)

## Success Checklist

- [ ] tyler@revoa.app exists in Supabase Auth
- [ ] User has is_admin: true in user_profiles
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] 3 products appear in admin panel
- [ ] Products are in "pending" status
- [ ] You can approve products
