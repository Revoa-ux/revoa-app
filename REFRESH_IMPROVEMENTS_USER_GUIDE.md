  - Normal for large ad accounts
  - Your metrics are still fully available

## When Things Go Wrong

### Scenario: "Metrics won't load"
**What you see:** Error toast, no data appears

**What to do:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify ad platform is still connected (Settings page)
3. Click refresh again
4. If persists, contact support with error message

### Scenario: "AI suggestions not showing"
**What you see:** Metrics load, but no AI badge or suggestions

**Possible reasons:**
- Cooldown period active (wait 5 minutes)
- No actionable insights found (AI will notify you)
- AI timed out (will retry on next refresh)
- Rate limit reached (wait a few minutes)

**What to do:**
- Check console for AI status messages
- Wait for cooldown period to expire
- Retry refresh after a few minutes
- Your metrics are still fully functional

### Scenario: "AI is stuck analyzing"
**What you see:** Blue badge for over 2 minutes

**What happens:**
- AI has automatic 2-minute timeout
- You'll see: "AI analysis is taking longer than expected"
- Badge will disappear
- Metrics remain fully functional
- AI will retry on next manual refresh

## Performance Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Don't spam refresh**
   - 5-minute cooldown prevents excessive AI calls
   - Data is cached for quick access
   - Only refresh when you need fresh platform data

2. **Let AI finish**
   - While metrics load instantly, AI needs time
   - Blue badge indicates AI is working
   - Don't refresh again until badge disappears

3. **Use cached data**
   - Initial page load uses cache (instant)
   - AI suggestions load in background
   - No need to refresh unless data is stale

4. **Monitor the timing**
   - Sync: ~3 seconds
   - Metrics: ~1 second
   - AI: 15-60 seconds (varies by account size)

## FAQ

**Q: Why do metrics load before AI suggestions?**
A: We split the refresh into two phases so you can start working immediately. AI analysis runs in the background without blocking you.

**Q: Can I use the table while AI is analyzing?**
A: Yes! The table is fully interactive. Click, sort, filter, drill down - everything works while AI runs in the background.

**Q: What if AI fails?**
A: Your metrics are never affected by AI failures. You'll see a specific error message, but all your data remains accessible.

**Q: How often should I refresh?**
A: Only when you need fresh data from platforms. The app uses smart caching, so data is available instantly on page load.

**Q: What does the 5-minute cooldown mean?**
A: AI won't regenerate suggestions if you refreshed recently. This prevents excessive API calls and respects rate limits. Your metrics still refresh normally.

**Q: Why does AI take so long?**
A: AI analyzes every campaign, ad set, and ad across multiple platforms using advanced algorithms. For large accounts with 100+ ads, this takes time. The good news: it doesn't block you anymore.

**Q: Can I skip AI analysis?**
A: Not currently, but it runs in the background so it doesn't slow you down. We may add a "Skip AI" option in the future.
