# Webhook HMAC Verification Fix

**Date:** November 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** Shopify automated checks failing on "Verifies webhooks with HMAC signatures"

---

## Problem Summary

Your Shopify app was failing the automated security check for webhook HMAC verification. While the code had HMAC verification implemented, it lacked critical security features that Shopify's automated checker requires:

1. **No timing-safe comparison** - Vulnerable to timing attacks
2. **Duplicated code** - Each webhook had its own HMAC implementation
3. **Inconsistent error handling** - Different webhooks handled failures differently

---

## What We Fixed

### 1. Created Shared HMAC Verification Module

**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/shopify-hmac.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Timing-safe string comparison (prevents timing attacks)
- ✅ Proper Web Crypto API usage
- ✅ Base64 encoding matching Shopify's format
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Fallback secret resolution (SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET → SHOPIFY_API_SECRET → SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET)
- ✅ Alternative hex-based verification for debugging

**Key Security Improvement:**
```typescript
// OLD: Vulnerable to timing attacks
return calculatedHmac === hmac;

// NEW: Timing-safe comparison
function timingSafeEqual(a: string, b: string): boolean {
  if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    result |= a.charCodeAt(i) ^ b.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return result === 0;
}
```

This prevents attackers from using timing differences to guess the HMAC signature.

---

### 2. Updated All Webhook Endpoints

**Updated Files:**
1. `supabase/functions/shopify-order-webhook/index.ts`
2. `supabase/functions/shopify-uninstall-webhook/index.ts`
3. `supabase/functions/data-deletion-callback/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed duplicate HMAC verification functions
- Import shared `verifyShopifyWebhook` function
- Import shared `getWebhookSecret` helper
- Consistent error handling across all webhooks
- Better logging for debugging

**Before:**
```typescript
async function verifyWebhookHmac(body: string, hmac: string, secret: string) {
  // ... custom implementation
  return calculatedHmac === hmac; // NOT timing-safe
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { verifyShopifyWebhook, getWebhookSecret } from '../_shared/shopify-hmac.ts';

// Uses timing-safe comparison automatically
const isValid = await verifyShopifyWebhook(body, hmac, secret);
```

---

### 3. Created Comprehensive Test Suite

**File:** `supabase/functions/_shared/shopify-hmac.test.ts`

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ Valid HMAC should be accepted
2. ✅ Invalid HMAC should be rejected
3. ✅ Modified body should fail verification
4. ✅ Wrong secret should fail verification
5. ✅ Empty body should be handled gracefully

**To Run Tests:**
```bash
deno run --allow-all supabase/functions/_shared/shopify-hmac.test.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🧪 Testing Shopify HMAC Verification

✅ Test 1 PASSED: Valid HMAC accepted
✅ Test 2 PASSED: Invalid HMAC rejected
✅ Test 3 PASSED: Modified body rejected
✅ Test 4 PASSED: Wrong secret rejected
✅ Test 5 PASSED: Empty body handled correctly

📊 Test Results
================
✅ Passed: 5
❌ Failed: 0
📈 Success Rate: 100.0%

🎉 All tests passed! HMAC verification is working correctly.
```

## How HMAC Verification Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Shopify sends webhook** with these headers:
   - `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256`: Base64-encoded HMAC signature
   - `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain`: The shop that triggered the webhook
   - `X-Shopify-Topic`: Event type (e.g., `orders/create`)

2. **Your webhook receives the request:**
   ```typescript
   const body = await req.text(); // Must be raw text, not parsed JSON
   const hmac = req.headers.get('X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256');
   const secret = getWebhookSecret(); // From environment variables
   ```

3. **Calculate expected HMAC:**
   ```typescript
   const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
     'raw',
     encoder.encode(secret),
     { name: 'HMAC', hash: 'SHA-256' },
     false,
     ['sign']
   );

   const signature = await crypto.subtle.sign('HMAC', key, encoder.encode(body));
   const calculatedHmac = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(signature)));
   ```

4. **Compare using timing-safe method:**
   ```typescript
   return timingSafeEqual(calculatedHmac, hmac);
   ```

5. **If valid:** Process the webhook
6. **If invalid:** Return 401 Unauthorized

---

## Environment Variables

Your webhooks use the following environment variables (in priority order):

```bash
# 1. Dedicated webhook secret (recommended)
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here

# 2. API secret (fallback)
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# 3. Client secret (fallback)
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

**Important:** All three should have the same value from your Shopify Partner Dashboard under "API credentials" → "Client secret"

**Your Current Value (from .env):**
```bash
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=8b8630af8cead966607dddb7ab5abee0
```

## Verification Checklist

### Before Submitting to Shopify

- [x] HMAC verification uses timing-safe comparison
- [x] All three webhooks use shared verification function
- [x] Environment variables are properly configured
- [x] Tests pass successfully
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Webhooks respond within 5 seconds
- [ ] Deploy updated webhook functions to Supabase ← **DO THIS NEXT**
- [ ] Test with actual Shopify webhook
- [ ] Verify in Shopify Partner Dashboard

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Webhooks

You need to deploy the three updated edge functions:

```bash
# Deploy all webhooks at once
supabase functions deploy shopify-order-webhook
supabase functions deploy shopify-uninstall-webhook
supabase functions deploy data-deletion-callback
```

**Note:** The `_shared` directory is automatically included when deploying functions.

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check function logs
supabase functions logs shopify-order-webhook --tail

# Test the endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-order-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: test" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

Expected response: `401 Unauthorized` (because HMAC is invalid)

### Step 3: Register Webhooks in Shopify

In your Shopify Partner Dashboard:

1. Go to **Apps** → **Revoa** → **Configuration**
2. Scroll to **Webhooks**
3. Ensure these are registered:

```
Topic: orders/create
URL: https://iipaykvimkbbnoobtpzz.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-order-webhook
API Version: 2025-01

Topic: orders/paid
URL: https://iipaykvimkbbnoobtpzz.supabase.co/functions/v1/shopify-order-webhook
API Version: 2025-01

## Testing with Shopify

### Method 1: Trigger Test Webhook (Recommended)

In Shopify Partner Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications** → **Webhooks**
2. Find your webhook
3. Click **Send test notification**
4. Check your logs to verify it was received and processed

### Method 2: Use Development Store

1. Install your app on a development store
2. Create a test order
3. Check Supabase function logs:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs shopify-order-webhook --tail
   ```
4. Look for: `[Order Webhook] HMAC verified successfully`

### Method 3: Use Shopify CLI

```bash
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/create --api-version 2025-01
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid HMAC signature"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Wrong secret in environment variables
2. Body was parsed as JSON before HMAC verification
3. Extra whitespace in body
4. Incorrect encoding

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Should match Shopify Partner Dashboard → API credentials → Client secret
# Redeploy with correct secret:
supabase functions deploy shopify-order-webhook --env-file .env
```

### Issue: "Webhook timeout"

**Cause:** Webhook taking >5 seconds to respond

**Solution:**
- Return 200 OK immediately after HMAC verification
- Process webhook data asynchronously
- Optimize database queries

### Issue: "Cannot find module '../_shared/shopify-hmac.ts'"

**Cause:** Shared module not deployed

**Solution:**
```bash
# The _shared directory should deploy automatically, but if not:
supabase functions deploy shopify-order-webhook --no-verify-jwt
```

## Why This Fix Works

### Security Improvements

1. **Timing-Safe Comparison**
   - Prevents attackers from measuring time differences
   - Makes brute-force attacks impractical
   - Industry standard for cryptographic comparisons

2. **Consistent Implementation**
   - All webhooks use the same verified code
   - Easier to audit and maintain
   - Reduces chance of implementation errors

3. **Proper Error Handling**
   - Failed verifications return 401 (not 500)
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Graceful degradation

### Shopify Compliance
