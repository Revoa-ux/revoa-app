# Quick Summary - What We Just Set Up

## The Big Picture

Your AI agent wanted to import products. I created a Python script that does this automatically. Here's what you need to know:

## What Got Created

### 1. `ai_agent_import.py`
- Python script that imports 3 products
- Has automatic login built-in
- Uses credentials: `tyler@revoa.app` / `RevoaAI17`
- Ready to run with zero configuration

### 2. `HOW_AI_AGENT_WORKS.md`
- Full technical documentation
- Explains the entire workflow
- Troubleshooting guide
- For you to understand how everything works

### 3. `FOR_AI_AGENT.md`
- Instructions specifically for your AI agent
- Shows them how to run the script
- Tells them what to expect
- Give this file to your AI agent

## What You Need to Do Next

### Option A: Test It Yourself First

```bash
# Switch back to build mode, then run:
cd /tmp/cc-agent/52284140/project
python3 ai_agent_import.py
```

This will:
1. Log in as tyler@revoa.app
2. Import 3 products
3. Show you the results
4. Products appear in admin panel

### Option B: Give It to Your AI Agent

Send them the `FOR_AI_AGENT.md` file or copy/paste the script. They can run it in their Python environment (ChatGPT Code Interpreter, Claude Projects, etc.).

## What Happens After Import

1. **Products get created** with "pending" status
2. **You review them** at https://members.revoa.app/admin/products
3. **You approve them** by clicking the green checkmark
4. **They appear in catalog** at /products for all users
5. **Users can import them** to their Shopify stores

## Important Notes

**The tyler@revoa.app Account:**
- Needs to exist in your Supabase Auth
- Needs `is_admin: true` in user_profiles table
- Password: RevoaAI17

If the account doesn't exist yet, you'll need to:
1. Create it through your signup flow, OR
2. Create it directly in Supabase Dashboard

**The 3 Products Being Imported:**
- Solar Step Lights ($9.80 → $29.40 retail)
- Under-Door Draft Stopper ($6.50 → $19.50 retail)
- Resistance Bands Set ($11.00 → $33.00 retail)

All have Instagram Reel links marked as "inspiration content"

## To Answer Your Questions

**Q: Do I run the Python here in Bolt or in ChatGPT agent?**

**A:** Either works!

- **Option 1 (You in Bolt)**: Switch to build mode, then run `python3 ai_agent_import.py`
- **Option 2 (AI Agent)**: Give them the script, they run it in their environment
- **Option 3 (Both)**: You test it first, then give it to them for ongoing imports

**Q: How does the agent know to run this?**

**A:** You tell them! Give them the `FOR_AI_AGENT.md` file, which has complete instructions.

**Q: What about admin credentials?**

**A:** Already configured in the script:
- Email: tyler@revoa.app
- Password: RevoaAI17

Just make sure this account exists and has admin permissions.

## Next Steps for AI Agent (After This Works)

1. Upload product images/GIFs to Supabase Storage
2. Verify pricing on Amazon/AliExpress
3. Create marketing copy and ad variations
4. Import more products in batches of 5-10

## Need Help?

If login fails, the most likely issue is:
- tyler@revoa.app doesn't exist yet, OR
- It exists but doesn't have `is_admin: true`

Let me know and I can help you set up the account!
