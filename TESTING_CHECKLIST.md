   - Click a campaign to drill down
   - Search for an ad
   - Sort by spend
   - Change date range
4. Verify all interactions work
5. Watch for blue badge to appear
6. Continue interacting while badge is visible
7. Verify badge disappears when AI completes

```

---

### 4. **AI Timeout Handling** ⚠️
**Test:** Verify timeout protection works (requires large ad account or slow connection)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] If AI takes over 2 minutes, timeout triggers
- [ ] Badge transforms back to red "Infused with Revoa AI"
- [ ] Toast: "AI analysis is taking longer than expected. Check back in a few minutes."
- [ ] Metrics remain fully functional

**How to Test:**
1. Use account with many ads (100+)
2. Click refresh
3. Wait for metrics to load
4. Wait 2+ minutes while AI runs
5. Verify timeout message appears
6. Verify badge is back to red
7. Verify table still works normally

**Console Output to Check:**
```
[Rex] AI analysis timed out - this is normal for large ad accounts
```

---

### 5. **AI Error Handling** ⚠️
**Test:** Verify graceful failure when AI encounters errors

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Metrics load normally (not affected by AI failure)
- [ ] Specific error message shown based on error type
- [ ] Table remains fully functional
- [ ] No app crash

**Possible Error Messages:**

- "AI analysis rate limit reached. Try again in a few minutes." (rate limit)
- "Network error during AI analysis. Please check your connection." (network)
- "AI analysis encountered an issue. Your metrics are still available." (generic)

**How to Test:**
1. Disconnect internet briefly during AI phase

4. Watch for blue badge to appear
5. Verify page is immediately interactive

**Console Output to Check:**
```
[Audit] Using fresh cache (2 min old)
[Rex] Loaded existing suggestions: X
```

---

### 7. **Cooldown Mechanism** ⏱️
**Test:** Verify 5-minute cooldown prevents excessive AI regeneration

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Facebook ads sync successfully
- [ ] TikTok ads sync successfully (if connected)
- [ ] Google ads sync successfully (if connected)
- [ ] Shopify orders sync successfully
- [ ] All platforms complete before metrics load

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Time to First Metrics:** < 5 seconds ✓
- **Time to Interactive Table:** < 5 seconds ✓
- **AI Generation Time:** 10-60 seconds (varies by account size)
- **Cache Load Time:** < 1 second ✓

### Acceptable Ranges
- **Sync Duration:** 1-4 seconds (depends on platform API)
- **Fetch Duration:** 0.5-2 seconds (depends on data size)
- **AI Duration:** 10-120 seconds (depends on ad count)

### Failure Thresholds
- **Metrics > 10 seconds:** Investigate network/sync issues
- **AI > 2 minutes:** Timeout should trigger automatically
- **Cache > 3 seconds:** Investigate database performance

## Console Commands for Testing

### Check Timing
```javascript
// Open console and watch for:
[Refresh] Phase 1: Sync completed in XXXXms
[Refresh] Phase 1: Data fetched in XXXXms
[Refresh] Phase 1 complete: XXXXms total
[Refresh] Phase 2: Starting background AI analysis...
[Refresh] Phase 2: AI analysis completed in XXXXms
```

### Force AI Timeout (for testing)
```javascript
// Temporarily reduce timeout in code:
const AI_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds instead of 2 minutes
```

### Check State
```javascript
// In React DevTools, watch:
isLoading: false (should become false quickly)
isGeneratingAI: true (should be true during AI)
creatives: [...] (should populate after Phase 1)
rexSuggestions: Map(X) (should populate after Phase 2)
```

- [ ] Ad Set drill-down works
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Sort functionality works
- [ ] Filter functionality works
- [ ] Date range selection works
- [ ] Platform filter works

- [ ] Accept suggestion creates automation rule
- [ ] Dismiss suggestion removes from view
- [ ] Status toggle works (pause/resume ads)
- [ ] Budget update works

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple browsers:

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

Test responsive layouts:

- [ ] Desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Laptop (1366x768)
- [ ] Tablet (768x1024)
- [ ] Mobile (375x667)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **AI Timeout on Large Accounts**
   - Accounts with 500+ ads may hit 2-minute timeout
   - This is expected behavior (graceful failure)
   - User can retry or wait for background completion

2. **Cooldown Period**
   - 5-minute cooldown prevents rapid AI regeneration
   - This is intentional to save costs
   - User should wait or use existing suggestions

3. **Cache Staleness**
   - Cache expires after 30 minutes
   - Stale data triggers automatic refresh
   - User may see brief loading on stale cache

---

## Success Criteria

### Critical (Must Pass)
- ✅ Metrics load in under 5 seconds
- ✅ Table is interactive during AI analysis
- ✅ AI failures don't break metrics display

- ✅ All visual indicators work correctly

### Important (Should Pass)
- ✅ AI completes within 2 minutes (or times out gracefully)

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

1. Revert commit: `git revert [commit-hash]`
2. Use legacy `loadRexSuggestions` function
3. Remove `isGeneratingAI` state and badge
4. Remove `setTimeout` pattern in `refreshData`
5. Test with previous blocking flow
