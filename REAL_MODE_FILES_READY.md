# âœ… Real Mode Files Are Ready!

This file confirms that all Real Mode components have been created.

## Files to Check in Git

After Bolt syncs, these files should appear in your GitHub repo at `https://github.com/Revoa-ux/revoa-app`:

### Core Workflow
- `.github/workflows/import-products.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow

### Python Script
- `scripts/revoa_import.py` - Price-first importer with GIF generation

### Edge Functions
- `supabase/functions/agent-dispatch/index.ts` - Triggers GitHub workflow
- `supabase/functions/agent-callback/index.ts` - Receives results

### Setup Documentation
- `START_HERE.md` - Quick 3-step guide
- `BOLT_GITHUB_SYNC.md` - How to sync with GitHub
- `after-github-push.sh` - Automated setup script
- `SECRETS_REFERENCE.md` - All secret values

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Files in Bolt UI
In Bolt's file explorer, check that you can see:
- `.github/workflows/import-products.yml`
- `scripts/revoa_import.py`
- `START_HERE.md`

### Step 2: Let Bolt Sync to GitHub
Bolt should automatically sync these files to `https://github.com/Revoa-ux/revoa-app`

You can also manually trigger a sync if Bolt has that option.

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub
Go to: `https://github.com/Revoa-ux/revoa-app`

Check that these files appear:
- `.github/workflows/import-products.yml`
- `scripts/revoa_import.py`

### Step 4: Configure Secrets
Run the setup script:
```bash
./after-github-push.sh
```

Or follow the manual steps in `START_HERE.md`

### Step 5: Test Real Mode
1. Go to `/admin/ai-import`
2. Click "Run AI Agent Now" (Real Mode)
3. Watch it execute on GitHub Actions!

## Troubleshooting

### If files don't appear in GitHub:
1. Check Bolt's sync status
2. Look for a "Push" or "Sync" button in Bolt
3. Check for any sync errors in Bolt's UI

### If you need to manually commit:
The files are all in your project directory. You can commit them manually if needed.
