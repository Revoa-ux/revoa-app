# 🐛 Bug Fix - Function Signature Mismatch

## What Was Wrong

The AI agent failed with error:
```
Error: discover_viral_reels() got an unexpected keyword argument 'min_views'
```

**Root Cause:** Function signature didn't match the call parameters.

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Function definition
def discover_viral_reels(hashtags, min_likes=10000, max_reels=50):
    ...
    if likes < min_likes:  # Wrong filter
    ...

# Function call
discover_viral_reels(DISCOVERY_TERMS, min_views=MIN_VIEWS, max_reels=MAX_REELS)
```

Parameter names didn't match!

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Function definition
def discover_viral_reels(search_terms, min_views=50000, max_reels=250):
    ...
    if views < min_views:  # Correct filter
    ...

# Function call
discover_viral_reels(DISCOVERY_TERMS, min_views=MIN_VIEWS, max_reels=MAX_REELS)
```

## Changes Made

1. ✅ Changed `hashtags` → `search_terms` (parameter name)
2. ✅ Changed `min_likes` → `min_views` (parameter name)
3. ✅ Changed filter from `likes < min_likes` → `views < min_views`
4. ✅ Updated sorting to use views: `views + likes + comments`
5. ✅ Fixed all references to `hashtag` → `term` in error messages
6. ✅ Changed hashtag reference to `search_term` in result dict

## Status

✅ Python syntax valid
✅ Project builds successfully
✅ Ready for next run

## What To Expect Next Run

The agent will now:
1. ✅ Use search terms correctly (not just hashtags)
2. ✅ Filter by **views** (50,000+ default) instead of likes
3. ✅ Process 56 rotating search terms from 140+ term library
4. ✅ Sort results by total engagement (views + likes + comments)
5. ✅ Return top viral reels for product identification

**Note:** Instagram may still block requests (~50% success rate for web scraping).
This is normal and expected. The agent will:
- Exit gracefully if no reels found
- Log clear reasons for failures
- Retry on next scheduled run (6 AM UTC daily)
